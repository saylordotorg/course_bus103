     Instructions: This 51-minute lecture provides a discussion of how
    business transactions are recorded as debits and credits. The
    concept of debits and credits will increase or decrease a specific
    account, depending on which account the transaction is impacting.
    Pay close attention to the part of the discussion that illustrates a
    normal balance of accounts. As you watch this video, keep in mind
    that references to chapters, quizzes and tests do not apply to you
    in this Saylor Foundation course. If Professor Krug provides a
    demonstration of a particular problem to the students in his class,
    you should indeed jump in and do the problems with the class and use
    his explanations to support your comprehension of the material being
    presented. Be sure you take detailed notes on this section of the
    course.

     Instructions: This 50-minute lecture discusses how to properly
    record debits and credits, ensuring you are communicating the
    information correctly. It takes you through the recording of
    business transactions from the concept of a journal entry to posting
    to a ledger, while ensuring that the integrity of debits and credits
    is maintained. Journal entries will be more fully discussed later in
    the course. To help you understand the concept of debits and
    credits, the instructor in the video will provide you with a
    compound business transaction and ask that the problem be translated
    into accounting language, ensuring the integrity of debits and
    credits. You should work through this problem along with the class
    so that you can get some hands-on practice. As you watch this video,
    keep in mind that references to chapters, quizzes, and tests do not

    or accounting. In this video, the instructor gives a quiz that you
    can do as additional practice. Keep in mind this is not a
    requirement for the completion of this course, but practice and
    repetition will help you more fully understand the concepts of
    accounting. Professor Krug gives specific direction, so follow his
    directions as presented in the video. As you watch this video, keep
