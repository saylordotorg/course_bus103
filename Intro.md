Course Syllabus for "BUS103: Introduction to Financial Accounting"
------------------------------------------------------------------

Accounting can be considered the language of business. If you are
learning accounting for the first time, embracing its foundational
concepts may be a challenging process. Mastery of accounting primarily
rests in your ability to critically think through and synthesize the
information as it applies to a given situation. You should approach the
learning of accounting the same way you would approach learning a
foreign language; It will take time and practice to ensure you remember
the concepts. There are a number of sub-disciplines that fall under the
umbrella of “accounting,” but in this course, we will be focused on
financial accounting. Accounting as a business discipline can be viewed
as a system of compiled data. The word *data* should not be confused
with “information.” In terms of accounting, “data” should be viewed as
the raw transactions or business activity that happens within any
business entity. For example: Someone uses $30,000 of their savings to
start a business. The use of these funds within the start of this new
business is in fact data. Now that you have this data, what are you
going to do with it? The answer to this question can be summed up in one
word – accounting! Taking this data and transforming it into useful
information is what happens when accounting is implemented within a
business. The word *information* should be viewed as the communicated
results of the data as it has happened in the business within a
specified period of time. This information is used by decision makers to
support how they determine specific courses of action within the
business. This course introduces you to financial accounting in
preparation for more advanced business topics within the business
major. Recording financial information in a standard format allows
managers, investors, lenders, stakeholders, and regulators to make
appropriate decisions regarding their respective interests. In this
course, the formats of focus will be identified as the Income Statement,
the Balance Sheet, Statement of Cash Flows, and Statement of
Shareholders’ Equity. In this course, you will learn how to compile and
analyze these financial statements, determine the value of a firm, and
compare the firm to its competitors.
