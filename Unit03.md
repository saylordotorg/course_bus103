**Unit 3: Adjustments for Financial Reporting** <span id="3"></span> 
*By now, you should have a foundational understanding of accounting and
its guiding principles and concepts. You will now need to learn how to
synthesize this information, which often requires an adjusting journal
entry. Before you can learn about adjusting entries, you will need to be
able to distinguish between cash- and accrual-based accounting. There is
some distinction between the two methods, and while some smaller
business may be able to effectively use a cash basis of accounting, most
organizations use an accrual basis of accounting. Subsequently, the
accrual basis is the foundation on which you are learning the concepts
presented in this course. *
