     Instructions: In this 50-minute lecture, you will see that when
    communicating business transactions as defined by accounting
    principles, the information will always be conveyed in a manner that
    suggests that you have balanced. To “balance” means that the left
    and the right sides of your accounting equation equal each other.
    When analyzing the activity of a business, there should always be an
    outcome where you have illustrated that which you expect to have
    some kind of useable future value (the asset) equating to whom you
    owe (liabilities) plus your potential claims on the items that you
    expect to have some kind of useable value (the *equity,* also known
    as shareholder or stakeholders equity). This is another way to look
    at the accounting equation, which you will be introduced to in
    subunit 1.3: ASSETS = LIABILITIES + OWNERS’ EQUITY. As you are
    watching the video, keep in mind that references to chapters,
    quizzes, and tests do not apply to you in this Saylor Foundation
    course. If Professor Krug provides a demonstration of a particular
    problem to the students in his class, you should indeed jump in and
    do the problems with the class and use his explanations to support
    your comprehension of the material being presented. Be sure you take
    detailed notes on this section of the course.

**1.3.6 The Financial Accounting Process** <span id="1.3.6"></span> 
*Note: This topic is identified in the primary text as Section 2.6. The
framework of the entire accounting process, which may also be identified
as the accounting equation, is discussed. The fundamental accounting
equation is the basic equation that accountants use to record business
transactions. The equation states “assets = liabilities + owners’
equity.” There are a number of elements within the accounting equation,
and this section of the course will provide you with the direct and
alternative identifications of these elements so you can begin to speak
the language of accounting.  
  
 While you will hear these three elements of the accounting equation
discussed and illustrated in multiple ways throughout this course, here
is an introduction:* Assets *are things that expect to have future value
to the company. For example, if the company buys a new car, this car has
future value to the company.* Liabilities *are promises to pay. Some
companies may not have all of the money to pay cash for the car, so they
will typically finance, or obtain credit for, and borrow the difference
between the down payment and the final price of the car. If approved,
the company now promises to pay back the bank or business entity who
gave the company money.* Owners’ Equity *is the owners’ claims on
assets. This basically means that, as an owner of the company, you have
a claim on the asset that is now identified as the new car the company
owns. *
