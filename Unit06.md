**Unit 6: Unit 6: Accounting for Inventory – Measuring and Reporting**
<span id="6"></span> 
*In order for many businesses to conduct daily activity, they will have
to buy merchandise for their end users. There are a number of ways to
account for the purchasing and integration of this merchandise within a
business, and the decision on how a business entity will account for
this from an accounting perspective rests on a number of factors. In
this section of the course, you will be introduced to the inventory
valuation concepts of FIFO – First in First Out and LIFO – Last in First
Out, as well as the concept of weighted-average. Choosing an inventory
valuation method is a major decision a merchandising business entity
will have to make even before the merchandise is purchased; it is also a
decision that dictates the valuation of the merchandise on hand within
the business entity. *
