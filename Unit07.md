**Unit 7: Receivables and Payables Identified** <span id="7"></span> 
*During the course of regular business, it is not uncommon to provide
credit to some customers. Once a business provides an extension of
credit, it now owns a promise that it will be paid back. As part of this
agreement, the business entity will charge interest at varying rates,
which are typically imposed based on the credit worthiness of the
customer. It is also not uncommon that the business will not be able to
collect some of these credit extensions. In accounting, we identify
these promises someone makes to a business entity as an accounts
receivable. This section of the course will provide analysis and insight
on accounts receivables and highlight specific information on what to do
when a business extends credit to its customers.  
  
 Also, during the regular course of business, there may come times where
the business entity needs to make specific purchases to support the
regular business activity, but they do not have enough cash on hand to
meet these demands from a current asset perspective. In these types of
situations, it is viable for a business entity to possess lines of
credit. In this type of situation, the business entity has created a
promise to pay someone else as a result of being extended a particular
line of credit or goods on credit. These types of transactions would be
considered payables and would in fact create liabilities for the
organization. Please remember that earlier in the course, you were
introduced to the fact that a liability can also be considered a promise
to pay. *

**7.2 Understanding Bad Debt and the Relationship to Receivables** <span
id="7.2"></span> 
**7.2.1 Bad Debt Defined** <span id="7.2.1"></span>

    “Bad Debt Part 1” (YouTube) and “Bad Debt Part 2”**
    Link: YouTube: College of Southern Maryland: Bruce Fried’s [“Bad
    Debt Part 1”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkhfEC0TByg) (YouTube)
    and [“Bad Debt Part 2”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqorM-ylOIk)
     (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: These lectures discuss bad debt. Professor Bruce
    Fried takes an interesting approach to explaining bad debt. Bad debt
    has to be accounted for if a business is doing any kind of business
    on account. Doing business on account means the entity allows its
    customers access to its goods or services in exchange for a promise
    to pay the business back. This relationship creates a receivable for
    the business and a liability for the customer. Professor Bruce Fried
    provides an example on what should be done within the accounting
    process to ensure proper allocations of bad debt. In the video,
    Professor Fried also provides two ways of identifying what he refers
    to as bad debt allocations or “guesstimate,” as he comically calls
    it.
